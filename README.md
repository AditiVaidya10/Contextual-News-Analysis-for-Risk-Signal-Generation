# Contextual News Analysis for Risk Signal Generation

## Overview
This project collects news articles from RSS feeds, applies NLP to extract entities, events, and sentiment, constructs a knowledge graph, and performs graph analysis to identify risk signals.

## Structure
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data collection, NLP processing, graph creation, and analysis.
- `data/`: Output of data collection and intermediate files.
- `visualizations/`: Graph visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Instructions
1. Run `scripts/rss_collector.py` to fetch the latest news articles.
2. Run `scripts/nlp_processor.py` to extract entities, sentiment, and events.
3. Run `scripts/graph_builder.py` to create a knowledge graph.
4. Run `scripts/graph_analysis.py` to analyze and visualize potential risk signals.

## Cloud Deployment
For scalability, consider:
- AWS Lambda for scheduled scraping.
- AWS Comprehend or OpenAI API for NLP.
- Neptune DB for graph storage.
- Step Functions to orchestrate workflows.

## Enhancements
- Add more feeds (e.g., financial crime sources).
- Use LLMs for deeper event extraction.
- Build a dashboard using Streamlit.
